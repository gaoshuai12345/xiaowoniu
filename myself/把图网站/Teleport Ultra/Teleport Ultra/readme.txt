            Teleport Ultra Version 1.65 for Windows 
    (c) 1997-2012 Tennyson Maxwell Information Systems, Inc.

The fastest, most powerful file-retrieving robot on the Internet. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations!  You have obtained the most powerful offline 
browsing and file-retrieving tool on the Internet.

Part Swiss Army knife, part chainsaw, Teleport Ultra is a fully 
automated, multithreaded, link-following, file-retrieving 
webspider. It will retrieve all the files you want -- and only 
the files you want -- from any part of the Internet. 

Teleport Ultra can also

   - Completely download a website, enabling you to "offline 
     browse" the site at much greater speeds than if you were to 
     browse the site online
   - Create an exact duplicate, or "mirror" of a website, 
     complete with subdirectory structure and all required files
   - Search a website for files of a certain type (and even size)
   - Download a list of files from the Internet
   - Explore every website linked from a central website
   - Search a website for keywords
   - Make a list of all pages and files on a website

Want to offline browse a website?  Want to grab 400 sound files 
for a multimedia presentation?  Looking for just the right 
background graphic?  A list of every web page and file on a 
shareware site? Found a huge archive of great graphics -- but 
don't want to wait for each of them to download?  Found a great 
link site, but don't have the time to check out every link?

No more waiting for slow pages to download.  No more clicking on
links for hours, only to find garbage at the end of your trail.

========================
UNLIMITED UPGRADE POLICY
========================

Because of the confusion over whether and when registered users 
will be eligible for free upgrades, we've decided to make it 
simple:  All upgrades to Teleport Ultra are free for registered 
users, regardless of version number.


======================
A NOTE ON JAVA SUPPORT
======================

As of version 1.29, Teleport Ultra uses an internal Java applet 
binary parser, and doesn't need to use the older "JavaPack" 
system distributed with previous versions of Teleport Ultra. 
If you have upgraded a Teleport Ultra v1.28 or previous 
installation, you can delete the files in the "bin" subdirectory
(there should be two files in that folder, CLASSES.ZIP and 
JAVAP.EXE), as those files are no longer necessary.


=======================
32-BIT WINSOCK REQUIRED
=======================

Teleport Ultra requires that you use a 32-bit winsock dll for
your Internet connections.  In most cases, the Windows Dial-Up 
Networking system will satisfy this requirement. Some third-party
winsocks, such as Trumpet, are also compatible with Teleport 
Ultra. If you are unsure of whether you are using a 32-bit 
winsock connection, contact your ISP or the organization that 
provided you with your connection software.

Some third-party utilities can convert between a 16-bit winsock 
and an application like Teleport Ultra that requires a 32-bit 
connection.  One such program is "connect-WSOCK32", a shareware 
utility available at
     http://vroom.web.de/connect/



=============================
MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95 BUG NOTE
=============================

Microsoft has confirmed that a bug in the Windows 95 operating 
system may cause your computer to crash while using the Internet.
The bug slowly leaks resources each time a connection is 
established to the Internet.  Because Teleport Ultra establishes 
many, many connections to the Internet while running, it is 
important that you install a patch from Microsoft that corrects 
this problem.  Microsoft provides the patch for United States 
users on its website, www.microsoft.com.

European users should locate the proper patch file for their 
language system. There is a search page on www.microsoft.com for 
finding the correct patch for non-US versions of Windows 95.


============================================
MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95 SERVICE PACK 1 BUG NOTE
============================================

Microsoft's Service Pack 1 contains a bug that can corrupt your 
system registry if you use Dial-Up Networking, or if you run 
applications that access Dial-Up Networking registry information 
(as Teleport Ultra does). Microsoft has released a patch that 
corrects this bug.  The patch can be found on www.microsoft.com, 
and SHOULD BE INSTALLED if you have installed Service Pack 1.


========================
REGISTERING Teleport Ultra
========================

Teleport Ultra is shareware.  You are granted a free license to 
use this software 40 times, after which the license and the 
software both expire.  If you decide that you like Teleport Ultra
-- and we hope that you do! -- you can register it, keep it, and 
use it as much as you like.  Registering the program is just like
buying it. There are really two good reasons to register Teleport
Ultra:

   1.  The program, and your license to use it, expire after you 
       have used it 40 times.
   2.  Until you register it, Teleport Ultra will only retrieve 
       up to 500 files per project.

Registration costs only $49.95 US.  And your registration is 
valid for all upgrades to the Teleport Ultra product. This means
that your registration number will work on every upgrade we 
release. In fact, if you send us your email address when you 
register, we'll notify you automatically every time we issue an 
upgrade.

We can accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover 
credit cards. We can also accept checks or money orders drawn 
on a  United States bank, or a foreign bank with a United States
clearing house.

To register Teleport Ultra, simply select Register from the Help 
menu. Teleport Ultra will display the Registration dialog box.  
There are two options for sending us your registration 
information:

Secure Server: Press this button to launch your browser and visit
our Secure Server.  Your order will be processed online and you 
will receive a registration code immediately!  Choose this option 
for fastest service.  You must have a secure browser (such as 
Netscape or Microsoft) to use this option. Credit card orders 
only, please.

Mail/Email/Fax: Press this button to display the Order Form and 
print it or save it to disk. You can then mail or email it to us,
or fax it to us. (Our address/fax number will appear on the form)
